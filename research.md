# Research

I work on galaxy evolution using HI 21 cm surveys to study gas accretion, angular momentum, and dark matter distribution.  
My current projects involve ultra-deep MeerKAT observations (MHONGOOSE), high-resolution GMRT surveys of dwarf galaxies, and studies of large-scale voids using the MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (SMGPS).

See my [CV](cv) for a full list of observing programs and publications.
