# Teaching

At UCT, I taught the Honours course **Extragalactic Astronomy**, integrating structured lectures with research-style activities.  
I aim to adapt content and pedagogy to suit student background, and enjoy mentoring students across research stages.

See the [CV](cv) page for a summary of my advising roles and related activities.
